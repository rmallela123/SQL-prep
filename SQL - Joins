#### Inner Join

This is the most common and also the default join type.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM Table_A
INNER JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.column_name = Table_B.column_name;
```

#### Left Join General Form

When you want include unmatched records from the left table.
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM Table_A
LEFT JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.column_name = Table_B.column_name;

#### Right Join General Form

When you want to include unmatched records from the right table.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM Table_A
RIGHT JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.column_name = Table_B.column_name;

#### Full Outer Join

When you want to include unmatched records from both tables.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM Table_A
FULL OUTER JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.column_name = Table_B.column_name;

FULL JOIN is commonly used in conjunction with aggregations to understand the amount of overlap between two tables.

#### Full Outer Join If Null
# Find only the unmatched rows in your tables.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM Table_A
FULL OUTER JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.column_name = Table_B.column_name;
WHERE Table_A.column_name IS NULL OR Table_B.column_name IS NULL
