#### Full Outer Join

When you want to include unmatched records from both tables.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM Table_A
FULL OUTER JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.column_name = Table_B.column_name;
```

FULL JOIN is commonly used in conjunction with aggregations to understand the amount of overlap between two tables.

#### Full Outer Join If Null

Find only the unmatched rows in your tables.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM Table_A
FULL OUTER JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.column_name = Table_B.column_name;
WHERE Table_A.column_name IS NULL OR Table_B.column_name IS NULL
```
