DELETE FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE CUSTOMER_ID IN (2,5)

# This deletes the rows from the CUSTOMER table where CUSTOMER_ID is either 2 or 5. 
If no matching records exist, nothing happens. CAN BE rolled back.

DELETE FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE CUSTOMER_ID = 5

# This attempts to delete the row where CUSTOMER_ID = 5.
However, if the first DELETE statement already removed CUSTOMER_ID = 5, this statement does nothing.

commit
# This finalizes all changes made by the DELETE statements.

________________________

TRUNCATE TABLE CUSTOMER;

# removes all records without filtering.
# faster than delete, as it doesnt log indivdual row deletions. 
# CANNOT be rolled back (unless inside a DBMS transaction).
